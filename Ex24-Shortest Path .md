# Ex24 Shortest Path and Reachability in a Heritage Town using BFS
## DATE: 21-11-2025
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program that, given a map of attractions in a heritage town connected by walking paths, recommends:
The shortest number of paths (minimum hops) from a starting attraction to a target attraction.
The number of reachable attractions from the same starting point using Breadth-First Search (BFS)


## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Represent the heritage town map as a graph using a HashMap where each key is an attraction and its value is a list of connected attractions (walking paths).
3. Implement a BFS traversal to:
   - Visit all reachable attractions from a given starting attraction.
   - Count the total number of reachable attractions.
4. Implement another BFS-based shortest path algorithm that:
   - Uses a queue and a distance map.
   - Tracks the shortest number of hops (edges) from the start to the target attraction.
5. In the `main()` method:
   - Define the map (graph).
   - Take a starting and target attraction.
   - Display the reachable attractions and the shortest distance.
6. Stop the program.

        int count = 0;
        for (boolean v : visited) if (v) count++;
        return count;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(), e = sc.nextInt();
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
